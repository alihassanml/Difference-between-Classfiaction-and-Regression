    "In machine learning, regression and classification are two types of supervised learning tasks. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of their differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regression\n",
    "1. **Objective**: The goal of regression is to predict a continuous output value.\n",
    "2. **Output**: The output is a real number (e.g., predicting the price of a house, temperature, stock prices).\n",
    "3. **Examples**:\n",
    "   - Predicting the price of a house based on features like size, location, and number of bedrooms.\n",
    "   - Estimating the amount of rainfall in a given area based on historical weather data.\n",
    "4. **Common Algorithms**:\n",
    "   - Linear Regression\n",
    "   - Polynomial Regression\n",
    "   - Ridge Regression\n",
    "   - Lasso Regression\n",
    "   - Support Vector Regression (SVR)\n",
    "   - Neural Networks (for regression tasks)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification\n",
    "1. **Objective**: The goal of classification is to predict a discrete class label.\n",
    "2. **Output**: The output is a category or class (e.g., classifying an email as spam or not spam, predicting the type of animal in an image).\n",
    "3. **Examples**:\n",
    "   - Determining whether an email is spam or not.\n",
    "   - Classifying a handwritten digit from 0 to 9.\n",
    "   - Predicting if a tumor is malignant or benign based on medical images.\n",
    "4. **Common Algorithms**:\n",
    "   - Logistic Regression\n",
    "   - Decision Trees\n",
    "   - Random Forest\n",
    "   - Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n",
    "   - k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)\n",
    "   - Neural Networks (for classification tasks)\n",
    "   - Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Differences\n",
    "- **Nature of the Problem**:\n",
    "  - Regression deals with predicting quantities (continuous values).\n",
    "  - Classification deals with assigning items to predefined categories or classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Evaluation Metrics**:\n",
    "  - Regression models are typically evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.\n",
    "  - Classification models are evaluated using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Output Format**:\n",
    "  - Regression produces a numerical output.\n",
    "  - Classification produces a categorical output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases\n",
    "- **Regression**:\n",
    "  - Predicting the future value of a stock.\n",
    "  - Estimating the cost of a construction project.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Classification**:\n",
    "  - Identifying fraudulent transactions.\n",
    "  - Recognizing objects in images.\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding these differences, you can choose the appropriate type of model and algorithm for your specific machine learning task."

    "In regression, the most basic and commonly used type is **Linear Regression**. The formula for linear regression is:\n",

    "\n",
    "In the context of logistic regression, the \"slope\" refers to the coefficients \\( \\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\ldots, \\beta_n \\) for the input features. Each coefficient represents the change in the log-odds of the outcome for a one-unit increase in the corresponding predictor variable.\n",

    "- \\( \\beta_1 \\) is the slope of the logistic regression line, indicating how the log-odds of \\( Y \\) change with a one-unit increase in \\( X_1 \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation of the Slope\n",
    "\n",
    "- If \\( \\beta_1 > 0 \\), as \\( X_1 \\) increases, the log-odds of \\( Y = 1 \\) increase, meaning the probability of \\( Y = 1 \\) increases.\n",
    "- If \\( \\beta_1 < 0 \\), as \\( X_1 \\) increases, the log-odds of \\( Y = 1 \\) decrease, meaning the probability of \\( Y = 1 \\) decreases.\n",
    "- If \\( \\beta_1 = 0 \\), \\( X_1 \\) has no effect on the log-odds of \\( Y \\).\n",
